        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello!
            I am Alex Villa, a undergraduate student at the University of California, Merced. 
            I am currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, with a minor in Applied Mathmatics(because math is fun!! - I'll let you decide if that is sarcasm)
            My academic career has spaned over many areas and locations. From starting in Merced to interning at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the summer of 2024, I have been able to experience a wide range of topics and areas of study.

            I deeply value my academic journey. I would not be in the current fields of interest 
            and projects if was not for many people that I have had to meet and work alongside with. From engaging 
            professors, amazing graduate student mentors, knowledgeable Industry and National Lab mentors. 
            Each of their individual guidance and insight have been instrumental to my current research interests. </p>
